## Box'n'Shelf

Application that is designed for managing your home items to help with giving you on the go information of what's at home

The web application will be the starting application that will focus mostly on adding/importing items and generating QR codes that can be printed manually via a printer

There will be a search feature where you can find items in the home via sub/cat/fam (might change this to room/loc/type)
Example: Pasta would be Kitchen/Pantry/Pasta, Toothbrush would be Bathroom/Counter/Hygene

This system for dividing the items up will help with organizing the items for data reasons, but also, it will help the user locate their items normal location.

Box'n'Shelf will be able to scan both QR codes or bardcodes for grocery items. This will make it flexible to manage your kitchen supplies that would have standardized barcodes
