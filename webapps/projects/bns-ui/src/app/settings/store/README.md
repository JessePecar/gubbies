## Store Settings

# Purpose

This is a page to be able to adjust the abilities at a store, in the store mode you will be able to change the different settings for the store that the user is assigned to

Currently, the only settings that we will be able to adjust would be:
- Store Information
  - Store Information will be a readonly view unless you have the permission to edit the store inforamation
    - Basic store information
    - Hours
    - Departments
      - Delivery Days

- Adjustment Options 
  - This will affect how adjustments are run on the system with the rules
  - CRUD Adjustment reasons
    - Delete will be a soft delete for reporting reasons
  - Modify adjustment reasons visibility for Sub/Cat/Fams and items (TBD: If items would be in here)
  - Modify adjustment reasons visibility for item properties (Ex: Can't do a donation on a retired item)

- Promotion Settings
  - This will affect what options we will have for creating promotions (visibility for general promotions is controlled at the sub/cat/fam)
